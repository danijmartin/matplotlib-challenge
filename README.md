# Matplotlib Challenge

This repository reviews drug trial data to determine if a new drug regimen is more effective than existing regimens on the market.

The data is first cleaned and mice with duplicate data are removed.

We then construct a Summary Statistics table using two different methods.

From there we begin graphically representing the data.  

Graphs utilized:  
Bar Charts (using Pandas and Matplotlib to plot) illustrating the number of measurements taken for each drug regimen  
Pie Charts (using Pandas and Matplotlib to plot) illustrating the number of male and female mice  
Box Plot comparing the top 4 drug regimens  
Line Plot reviewing the tumor size over time for a randomly selected mouse that received the new drug regimen  
Scatter Plot with linear regression for average tumor volume and mouse weight
